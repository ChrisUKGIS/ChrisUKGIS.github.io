This is a website all about how I got coded up on the wrong side of the spam.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to do some coding so if you sit right there I'll detail how I became a distance learning MSc student at Leeds.
<br/>
<br/>
In West London born and raised on the internet I spent most of my days. Building my PCs and modding all cool, shooting BBs guns outside of school.
<br/>
<br/>
When a couple of thoughts were up to no good, started thinking careers in my local neighbourhood. I had one bad result and my mum got scared.
<br/>
<br/>
And I moved to study and learn in Leicester.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I studied and learned up there day after day but I still wanted to join the Army.
<br/>
<br/>
They gave me a scroll and I went on my way.
<br/>
<br/>
First phase was quite strict.
<br/>
<br/>
Breathing CS in a gas chamber. Is this what Army people live like? No worries, I should be alright.
<br/>
<br/>
Wait they like to drink, play games and all that?
