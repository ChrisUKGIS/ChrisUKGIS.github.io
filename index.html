This is a website all about how I got coded up on the wrong side of the spam.
<br/>
I'd like to do some coding so if you sit right there I'll detail how I became a distance learning MSc student at Leeds.
<br/>
In West London born and raised on the internet I spent most of my days. Building my PCs and modding all cool, shooting BBs guns outside of school.
<br/>
When a couple of thoughts were up to no good, started thinking careers in my local neighbourhood. I had one bad result and my mum got scared.
<br/>
Off to De Montfort University she said.
