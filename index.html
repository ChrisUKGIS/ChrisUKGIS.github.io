<p>
This is a website all about how I got coded up on the wrong side of the spam.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to do some coding so if you sit right there I'll detail how I became a distance learning  
  <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/">MSc student at Leeds.</a> 
<br/>
<br/>
In West London born and raised on the internet I spent most of my days. Building my PCs and 
  <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stevocarty">modding</a> all cool, shooting BBs guns outside of school.
<br/> 
<br/>
When a couple of thoughts were up to no good, started thinking careers in my local neighbourhood. I had one bad result and my mum got scared.
<br/>
<br/>
  And I moved to study and learn in <a href="https://www.dmu.ac.uk/home.aspx">Leicester.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I studied and learned up there day after day but I wanted to join the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUxYXX7pFp4">Army.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
  They gave me a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_IlNbsILLE">scroll</a> and I went on my way.
<br/>
<br/>
  First phase was <a href="https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/our-schools-and-colleges/">quite strict.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Breathing CS in a gas chamber. Is this what Army people live like? No worries, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqGH6MEIm-0">I should be alright.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait they like to drink, play games and all that? Is this the <a href="https://apply.army.mod.uk/roles/royal-engineers/surveyor">type of place</a> my skills are best at?
<br/>
<br/>
Not any more, I can see I'm prepared for the <a href="https://www.fim-trust.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Back-to-Civvy-Street-Report.pdf">switch to civvy air.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The train arrived and I jumped out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAMA8RpDFXM">London had changed since many young nights out.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't trying to use my skills yet, I had just got back.
<br/>
<br/>
  I quickly found work at <a href="https://atos.net/en/">ATOS IT</a> and into the morning rush dissapeared.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted a challenge but none came near so I looked for something fresh to consider
<br/>
<br/>
If anything I wanted to be more hands on so then I became a <a href="https://www.bridgeway-consulting.co.uk/">Rail Engineer.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Rail engineering meant always working late, I changed my job again slightly later.
<br/>
<br/>
I took stock of my skillset, started the <a href="https://courses.leeds.ac.uk/7411/geographical-information-systems-msc">MSc</a>, now its studying time working at the MOD.
