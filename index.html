The Fresh Prince2 of London Air
<h1/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
This is a website all about how I got coded up on the wrong side of the spam.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to do some coding so if you sit right there I'll detail how I became a distance learning  
  <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/">MSc student at Leeds.</a> 
<br/>
<br/>
In West London born and raised on the internet I spent most of my days. Building my PCs and modding all cool, shooting BBs guns outside of school.
<br/> 
<br/>
When a couple of thoughts were up to no good, started thinking careers in my local neighbourhood. I had one bad result and my mum got scared.
<br/>
<br/>
And I moved to study and learn in Leicester.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I studied and learned up there day after day but I still wanted to join the Army.
<br/>
<br/>
They gave me a scroll and I went on my way.
<br/>
<br/>
First phase was quite strict.
<br/>
<br/>
Breathing CS in a gas chamber. Is this what Army people live like? No worries, I should be alright.
<br/>
<br/>
Wait they like to drink, play games and all that? Is this the type of place my skills are best at?
<br/>
<br/>
Not any more, I can see I'm prepared for the switch to civvy air.
<br/>
<br/>
The train arrived and I jumped out. London had changed since many young nights out.
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't trying to use my skills yet, I had just got back.
<br/>
<br/>
I quickly found work at ATOS IT and into the morning rush dissapeared.
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted a challenge but none came near so I looked for something fresh to consider
<br/>
<br/>
If anything I wanted to be more hands on so then I became a Rail Engineer.
<br/>
<br/>
Rail engineering meant always working late, I changed my job again slightly later.
<br/>
<br/>
I took stock of my skillset, started the MSc, now its studying time working at the MOD.
